/**
 * 1. Explain what a hash table is
 * 2. Define what a hashing algorithm looks like
 * 3. Discuss what makes a good hashing algorithm
 * 4. What happens when collisions occur in a hash table? What does it mean for there to be a collision?
 * 5. Strategies for handling them: chaining or linear probing.
 *
 *
 *
 * Hash tables are used to store key-value pairs.
 * Keys in a hash table are not ordered.
 * Unlike arrays, they are fast for all of the following: lookups, insertions, and deletions
 *
 * Hsh tables in the wild:
 *  JS: Objects and Maps
 *  Python: Dictionaries
 *  Java, Go, Scala: Maps
 *  Ruby: Hashes
